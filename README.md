📊 Retail Sales Performance Dashboard
This repository contains the assets and documentation for a data analysis project focused on building a retail sales performance dashboard using Power BI. The goal of this project is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful insights and interactive visualizations to help business users monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and understand sales trends.

🎯 Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to create a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard that provides a high-level overview of retail sales performance. The dashboard will answer critical business questions, such as:

What is our total revenue, and how is it trending over time?

How many unique customers have we served?

What is our average order value?

Which products and countries are driving the most revenue?

📂 Data Source
The analysis is based on the Online Retail.xlsx dataset, which contains transactional data for a UK-based online retailer. The dataset includes key fields such as:

InvoiceNo: Unique identifier for each transaction.

Description: Product name.

Quantity: Number of units sold.

InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction.

UnitPrice: Price per unit.

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Country: Country of the customer.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Power BI Desktop: Used for data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create measures for key metrics.

📈 Dashboard Features
The final dashboard includes the following key visualizations and interactive components:

Card Visualizations: Displaying high-level KPIs: Total Revenue, Total Unique Customers, and Average Order Value.

Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart): Showing revenue performance over time.

Top Products & Countries (Bar Charts): Highlighting the top-performing products and countries by revenue.

Geographical Map: Visualizing revenue distribution by country with bubble sizes representing the revenue amount.

Slicers: Allowing users to filter the dashboard by Invoice Date, Country, and Description to explore data dynamically.
